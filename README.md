# Sb::Cli
Hello Welcome to my Pokedex Read-Me
This is a Pokedex Gem that has the ability to show pokemon in a list and display some details about them. 
Within this gem we can also look up some pokemon moves along with move stats.
The list is limited to the first 151 pokemon, but can easily be tweaked to show them all.

adding a team builder


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sb-cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sb-cli

## Usage

After installing the gem, you can run it by typing ./bin/sb which will start the pokedex. You will be given a list of propmpts, choose one to continue on. You can choose to view pokemon or pokemon moves.

To quit the program at any time just simply type exit to quit the program.

To get rid of the limit on pokemon being listed just change out the arrays that are uncommented with the ones being usedin the pre battle method.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
